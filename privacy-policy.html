                  </p> <p><strong>Cookies</strong></p> <p>
                    Cookies are files with a small amount of data that are
                    commonly used as anonymous unique identifiers. These are
                    sent to your browser from the websites that you visit and
                    are stored on your device's internal memory.
                  </p> <p>
                    This Service does not use these “cookies” explicitly.
                    However, the app may use third party code and libraries that
                    use “cookies” to collect information and improve their
                    services. You have the option to either accept or refuse
                    these cookies and know when a cookie is being sent to your

                    able to use some portions of this Service.

                    I may employ third-party companies
                    and individuals due to the following reasons:

                    I want to inform users of this
                    Service that these third parties have access to your
                    Personal Information. The reason is to perform the tasks
                    assigned to them on our behalf. However, they are obligated
                    not to disclose or use the information for any other
                    purpose.

                    commercially acceptable means of protecting it. But remember
                    that no method of transmission over the internet, or method
                    of electronic storage is 100% secure and reliable, and
                    I cannot guarantee its absolute security.

                    Note that these external sites are not operated by
                    me. Therefore, I strongly advise you to

                    I discover that a child under 13 has provided
                    me with personal information,
